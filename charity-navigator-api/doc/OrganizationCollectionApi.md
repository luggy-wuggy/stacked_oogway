Retrieve a list of the organizations available in the Charity Navigator Data Store. Allows paged retrieval, simple and advanced searching.

### Example
```dart
import 'package:openapi/api.dart';

final api_instance = OrganizationCollectionApi();
final appId = appId_example; // String | 3Scale App ID: unique identifier for an application registered in the Charity Navigator  developer portal.
final appKey = appKey_example; // String | 3Scale App Key: a secret key to authenticate the assigned App ID.
final pageSize = 56; // int | Number of organizations to return in a single response message. Used in combination with `pageNum` for paged responses. Default value is 100.  If specified, must be an integer value between 1 and 1,000.
final pageNum = 56; // int | Page number to return, in case the number of available objects in the result set is greater than the specified or default `pageSize`. Default value is 1. If the value of pageNum is greater than the number of pages in the result set, the method will return a 404 error. If the requested starting position, computed as `((pageNum-1) * pageSize) + 1`, is greater than the maximum supported result size of 10,000 objects, the method will return a 400 error.
final search = search_example; // String | A simple search string that narrows the results to organizations matching the specified search terms. This is a relevance-driven search, not an exact match. Whitespace-separated terms in the search string are combined using AND logic, so adding terms has the effect of narrowing the search. By default, the search looks for matches in all string or text properties. The searchType parameter can change the field values included in the search.

final rated = true; // bool | .Specifies whether to include only rated charities or unrated charities. By .default, all charities will be returned. . .Can be specified as `TRUE` or `FALSE`, `0` or `1`, or included without a value, .which is equivalent to `TRUE` or `1`. . .| Usage | Search Behavior | .| --- | --- | .| `rated=TRUE`<br/>`rated=1`<br/>`rated` | Return only rated charities. | .| `rated=FALSE`<br/>`rated=0` | Return only unrated charities. | .| (default) | Return all charities. | . .Any value other than the ones specified in the table above will cause an HTTP .400 error response.
final categoryID = categoryID_example; // String | ID of a Category. Search results will be filtered to include only organizations in the specified category.
final causeID = causeID_example; // String | ID of a Cause. Search results will be filtered to include only organizations in the specified cause.
final fundraisingOrgs = true; // bool | .Specifies whether to include or exclude organizations flagged by Charity .Navigator as fundraising organizations.

final state = state_example; // String | If set to a valid 2-letter state code (not case-sensitive), filters search results to include only organizations in the specified state. An invalid state code will respond with a 400 error.
final city = city_example; // String | Filters search results to include only organizations in cities whose names match the specified string. This uses fuzzy matching, and the city name may be given as a partial string.
final zip = zip_example; // String | Filters search results to include only organizations in the specified zip code.
final minRating = 56; // int | Filters search results to include only organizations with a rating greater than or equal to the specified value. Must be an integer value betwen 0 and 4, inclusive. Must be less than or equal to maxRating, if specified.
final maxRating = 56; // int | Filters search results to include only organizations with a rating less than or equal to the specified value. Must be an integer value betwen 0 and 4, inclusive. Must be greater than or equal to minRating, if specified.

final sort = sort_example; // String | .Specifies how results should be sorted. By default, results are sorted by .increasing `ein` value unless a `search` string is specified, in which case .results are sorted by decreasing relevance to the search string. . .This parameter takes the form of a sort property and an optional direction .indicator, separated by a colon.
